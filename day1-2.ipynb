      "To fulfill the request from a historical perspective: Existentialism is a modern philosophical movement that emerged in the 20th century, emphasizing individual freedom and choice as fundamental aspects of human existence. It challenges traditional views by focusing on personal responsibility and the search for meaning within an often indifferent or even absurd universe. Key figures in existentialist thought include SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus. This philosophy has had a significant impact on modern literature, arts, and social movements, shaping our understanding of the human condition and personal identity. - Expected type: none\n",
